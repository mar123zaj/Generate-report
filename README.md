# Recruitment task

# How to use it?

Use function prepare_report() and give name of file, where you have input data.

```
prepare_report('input_file.csv')
```

# Additional information

Function do something more than just change the data. I thought that good idea will be to :
1. Add option to choose output file name, default is 'Report YYYY-MM-DD', where date is this day.
2. Add option to choose if we want headers in output file for more readability.
3. Check if input file has headers.
